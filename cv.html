                                    <p>I’ve worked across Centerfield’s verticals writing news pieces, buyer’s guides, and product reviews on home security, consumer tech, and digital privacy. My writing is heavily SEO-focused, but I’ve also had the creative leeway to pitch, research, and develop a number of deep dives and buzzier pieces on my own.</p>

                                    <p>At Storyline, my job was to discover ideas and voices that resonated with audiences and turn them into stories that defined the brands I wrote about. I helped small-to-medium-sized businesses — and some bigger names like Bank of Cyprus, JCC Payment Systems,  Cobalt Aero, and Ancoria Insurance — tell their stories across their marketing channels.</p>

Apart from founding and directing the center, I also taught short story writing, live storytelling, and creative blogging.</p>

                                    <p>My extra is in fiction and journalism, so telling company stories is second nature.

I’m also a website designer, and occasionally have the chance to design the websites I write. All of which is to say that I never write a word without imagining how it will look on the page.</p>
